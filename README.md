# Contract

This is simple code used to explain the require,assert and revert statements.


## Description

This Solidity smart contract named errors contains three functions, Require(), Revert(), and Assert(). Require() uses the req() statement to check if the value of z is greater than two, otherwise it throws an error. Revert() uses rev(uint c)checks if c is a multiple of 5, otherwise it throws an error. Assert() uses the asser() statement to check if a and b  is greater than one, otherwise it throws an error.
 

## Requirements

To use this contract, you will need a Solidity development environment, such as Remix, Truffle, or Hardhat. You will also need a test network or a local blockchain to deploy and test the contract.
## Usage

To use this contract, follow these steps:

1)Open the Solidity development environment of your choice and create a new file.

2)Copy and paste the contents of 1.sol into your file.

3)Compile the contract to check for any errors or warnings.

4)Deploy the contract to a test network or a local blockchain.

5)Call the rev function with a uint value as an argument.

6)Check that the value variable has been set correctly by reading its value.
